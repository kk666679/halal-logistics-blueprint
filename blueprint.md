        });
    }

    function verifyCertification(string memory _certificateId) public view returns (bool) {
        return certifications[_certificateId].isValid && certifications[_certificateId].expiryDate > block.timestamp;
    }
}
```

### Marketplace Contract

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract HalalMarketplace {
    struct Product {
        uint256 id;
        string name;
        uint256 price;
        address payable vendor;
        bool isSold;
    }

    uint256 public productCount = 0;
    mapping(uint256 => Product) public products;

    function listProduct(string memory _name, uint256 _price) public {
        productCount++;
        products[productCount] = Product({
            id: productCount,
            name: _name,
            price: _price,
            vendor: payable(msg.sender),
            isSold: false
        });
    }

    function buyProduct(uint256 _id) public payable {
        Product storage product = products[_id];
        require(product.id > 0, "Product does not exist");
        require(!product.isSold, "Product already sold");
        require(msg.value == product.price, "Incorrect payment");

        product.vendor.transfer(msg.value);
        product.isSold = true;
    }
}
```
